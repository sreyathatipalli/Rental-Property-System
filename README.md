# Rental-Property-System
This is a code file for a Rental Property System, where we can post the availability of a new property that is available for rent.
We can also retrieve data of the rental properties based on the details of the rental property that would satisfy the search criteria.

Note: This is only a backend part, where the database software is MongoDB and the connection to the the database is made via Java
